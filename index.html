      <h3><b>INTER-COLLEGIATE INNOVATION TOURNAMENT</b></h3>
        <p>
          The Chicago Innovation Chase is a national
          inter-collegiate innovation tournament<br> designed in collaboration with leading
          industry experts and academics in order to<br> prepare raw science, tech, engineering
          and mathematics talent to solve problems<br> that are relevant and urgent, so they
          can save the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          We serve as the missing link in STEM education; Students are prepared to deal
          with<br> the increasing complexity of the industry by solving real-world problems
          within<br> spaces that mimic the multi-faceted, diverse, high pressure conditions in the
          world of<br> innovation. Change agents and experts from industry and academia help to
          develop<br> and test our curriculum each year, keeping it consistently cutting-edge,
          current,<br>
           and high impact.

    <div id="inbrief">
      <h3><b>DO YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A CHASE COMPETITOR</b></h3>
        <p>
          What we are looking for is spunk, smarts, integrity, honor, quick thinking, restlessness,<br> creativity, good attitude, and mad skill.  We are looking for IIT students who think<br> science is cool, who think design is important, who get bored easily, and who want<br> to save the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          This isn't an engineering competition.  This isn't a tournament to test your academic<br> ability.  We aren't just looking for the Straight A kids.  There is no minimum GPA to<br> participate in the Chicago Innovation Chase just like there is no minimum GPA to<br> save the world.
