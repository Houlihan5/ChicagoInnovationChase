        <p>
          The Chicago Innovation Chase is a national
          inter-collegiate innovation tournament designed in collaboration with leading
          industry experts and academics in order to prepare raw science, tech, engineering
          and mathematics talent to solve problems that are relevant and urgent, so they
          can save the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          We serve as the missing link in STEM education; Students are prepared to deal
          with the increasing complexity of the industry by solving real-world problems
          within spaces that mimic the multi-faceted, diverse, high pressure conditions in the
          world of innovation. Change agents and experts from industry and academia help to
          develop and test our curriculum each year, keeping it consistently cutting-edge,
          current, and high impact.

      <h3>DO YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A CHASE COMPETITOR</h3>
        <p>
          What we are looking for is spunk, smarts, integrity, honor, quick thinking, restlessness, creativity, good attitude, and mad skill.  We are looking for people who think science is cool, who think design is important, who get bored easily, and who want to save the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          This isn't an engineering competition.  This isn't a tournament to test your academic ability.  We aren't just looking for the Straight A kids.  There is no minimum GPA to participate in the Chicago Innovation Chase just like there is no minimum GPA to save the world.
